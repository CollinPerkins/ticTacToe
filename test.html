        <h4>Qualifying Referrals</h4>
        <p>Active Ammo Subscription customers can earn Store Credits towards future purchases if:</p>
        <p>A referred friend must make a purchase through the active customer's unique referral link The referred friend must successfully complete an order totaling $40.00 or more.</p>
        <p>If your friend does not click on the personal referral link in their invite email or any other invite mechanism to accept your invitation, you may not receive Store Credits and we will have no liability to you because there is no discernible way to identify that the purchase resulted from your referral.</p>
        <p>Rewards are payable in increments of $20 unless explicitly noted. Please allow up to 1-3 business days for the $20 credit to be added to your account after your referred friend places their order. As an active customer, you are responsible for any and all tax liability resulting from Referral Rewards.</p>
        <p>Active Ammo Subscription customers are limited to one Qualified Referral for each referred friend; in other words, additional/repeat purchases made by a referred friend are not counted as additional Qualified Referrals.</p>
        <p>Once you join Ammo Subscription, you can earn 10% referral credits on the initial order from every friend that you sign up.</p>
        <p>To refer a friend, just copy your unique referral link from your account page, share it with a friend, and make sure they click on your link to join.</p>
        <p>For every friend that you successfully refer, you get 10% credit based on the total from their purchase added to your account.</p>
        <p>Ammo Subscription credits are applied to charges for monthly subscriptions and can also be used to purchase Ammo Subscription products each month.</p>
        <p>These Ammo Subscription credits will be applied first before any charges for your monthly subscription each month.</p>

In addition, you must be at least 18 years old, and be legally permitted to provide the personal information (e.g., name and email address) of each Referred Customer.
